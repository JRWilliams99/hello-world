<h1>Maui: The Valley Isle</h1>
<p>Maui has long been recognized as one of the most beautiful locations on earth. Scores of waterfalls, scenic drives and film 
worthy valleys are spread across this 727 square mile island. Maui is the second island out of the 8 Hawaiian island second 
only to Hawaii aka "Big Island." It was discovered around 450 A.D by polynesian settlers and who brought their own traditions
 of diet, language, religion and monarchy to the island. In 1778, Captain James cook was the first European explorer to reach Maui.
 Soon after that weaponry like cannons and rifles changed course of history as King Kamehameha of Big Island used them to conquer 
 Maui and nearby Oahu. Traditionally chiefs and kings were in charge 
of vast areas on each island but there had never been a unified leader of all 8 islands.<br>
<br> 
Christian missionaries flocked to the island to spread American culture, religion and even created the first Hawaiian alphabet. The existed
several conflicts between Sailors living on the island during the booming whaling market and Catholic missionaries and natives who were starting 
to be disemfranchised by growing foreign expansion. Missionaries pushed for tough laws forbidding drunkeness, gambling and sexual intermingling 
between foreigners and natives. Additionally the the Great Mahele, a decision to divide Hawaiian owned lands into land that was owned by kings. chiefs,
foreigners and commoners who worked on the land. This plan backfired due to the rigid property tax system that fewer than 1 percent of commoners and 
eventually chiefs could afford.
